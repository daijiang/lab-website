Understanding the causes and consequences of changes in ecological communities (e.g. species distributions, species compositions, plant phenology, and biodiversity) is critical in today's changing world. We use observational studies, manipulative experiments, ecoinformatics, statistical modeling – often as part of an interdisciplinary collaboration – to test basic ecological theory and to provide information useful for managing and conserving biodiversity. Specifically, We: 

1. study large-scale ecological patterns using big data and bioinformatics 
2. analyze long-term datasets to study patterns of changes in biodiversity and communities as they respond to global change
3. develop statistical methods and use bioinformatics to reveal mechanisms underlying the large-scale and long-term changes we observe in ecological systems. 

Information about specific research themes can be found below.
